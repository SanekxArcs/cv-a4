      "Starting as an intern during my studies, I had the opportunity to pursue my passion for photo editing and secured a position as a Junior Retoucher / Photo Editor. Throughout my tenure, I acquired a multitude of skills in photo editing, resulting in improved speed and quality of my work. Starting from approximately 10 photos per day, I achieved a personal record of 97 photos per day. My accomplishments were reflected in the company's statistics, and I was recognized as Employee of the Month on five occasions within 16 months of work. This recognition led to my promotion to the position of Middle Retoucher and Junior Video Montager in 2019. During this time, I also had the opportunity to train new team members, some of whom I continue to collaborate with to this day.",
